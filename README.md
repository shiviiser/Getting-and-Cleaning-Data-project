Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-project
=================================

Course Project 
To source r-code i.e run_analysis.R you need to keep code and data i.e obtained from this link (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) 
in same file
manually unzip the file or you can just add a line on top of run_analysis code unzip(name_of_data).

source code will creat a file named data in which extracted tidy data will be placed in your working directory folder so make sure you dont have a file named data in  your current working directory.

1st cleaned merged data of test and train will be created
then 2nd data set of mean and standard deviation will be created.
